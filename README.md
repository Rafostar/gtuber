# Gtuber
C library to fetch media info from websites

* **[Documentation](https://rafostar.github.io/gtuber/doc/)**
* **[Examples](https://rafostar.github.io/gtuber/examples/)**

### GStreamer Integration
Gtuber includes a GStreamer plugin.
Once installed it will be automatically used when you try playing video from website that Gtuber can handle in your GStreamer based application.

For optimal performance, using stream-aware elements like `playbin3` and GStreamer 1.22 or later is recommended.
